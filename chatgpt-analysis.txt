About Project Jake:

Project Jake, named for Elizabeth “Jake” Feinler, is aimed at developing a comprehensive framework for expressing collection, labeling, and access rules for the Registration Data Directory Services (RDDS), commonly known as WHOIS. Its goal is to establish a robust foundation for data collection and disclosure policies pertaining to the domain name system in the ever-evolving and complex landscape of the internet.

Origin and Evolution of WHOIS:

The concept of WHOIS traces back to the early days of ARPANET, pre-dating the internet and the Domain Name System (DNS). Initially, it primarily involved identifying technical and administrative contacts responsible for managing the shared computers. Today, this simple structure has been intricately complicated by global privacy regulations, intricate business frameworks, and conflicting policies.

Key Objectives of Project Jake:

Project Jake will initiate its mission by constructing and popularizing a model and framework that can effectively express the intricate interactions of various stakeholder requirements. Implementing this framework will facilitate the appropriate expression of contact information via RDDS, aligning with the governing policies of specific stakeholder groups. This approach will enable future governance and policy makers to make informed decisions by comprehensively understanding the implications and costs associated with their proposed changes.

Challenges and Solutions:

Edgemoor Research Institute's Project Jake seeks to address the challenges arising from new global privacy legislation, making it challenging for various user groups to access crucial domain name contact information for legitimate purposes. By developing a framework for expressing collection, labeling, and access rules for RDDS, Edgemoor aims to streamline data sharing processes while ensuring compliance with legal obligations and safeguarding the interests of both data collectors and requesters.

Stakeholders and Goals:

Key stakeholders, including collectors, requestors, protectors, and policy authorities, have diverse interests in and concerns regarding accessing or providing access to domain name registration data. They share common goals, such as complying with legal requirements, ensuring timely response to requests, and safeguarding privacy rights. However, they face various frustrations, including inconsistent international laws, complex data requests, and abuse of WHOIS data.

Edgemoor's Initiatives:

Edgemoor Research Institute actively engages with stakeholders to bridge gaps between their goals and frustrations. Some of their notable contributions include a Gap Analysis of Registration Data Handling, a Registration Data Dictionary, and the Rules Normalization and Application (RNA) service, a web-based policy comparison tool.

To get involved with their efforts or support their initiatives, reach out to Edgemoor Research Institute, a 501(c)(3) corporation, to learn more about their ongoing work. For more information, refer to their site's Privacy Policy (7 June 2021), which emphasizes user privacy and data protection.
